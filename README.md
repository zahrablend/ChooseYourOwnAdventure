# ChooseYourOwnAdventure

This is a classic text-based Console Game using C#. 
In the game, a user is following the story and interacting with game logic through input.
The game logic is created using conditional statements.

## To Do

Create a .NET Core WEB variation of this game using Razor Pages (and possibly MVC).

### Ambition

Update user story and game logic by adding more elements. Current Story is taken from CodeCademy's BUILD WEB APPS WITH ASP.NET course.
